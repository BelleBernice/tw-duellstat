<dd>New: Banking helpers:
	<ul>
	<li>A click on the money in the bank (at the top of the game) allows you to deposit your cash, if you are in a town. This is enabled by default.
	<li>You can be asked if you want to deposit your money if you reach your home town. This has to be enabled in the settings, because clothcalc has the same feature, and it would be annoying be asked twice.
	</ul>
<dd>New: Enhancements to the auction window (like clothcalc did). These are turned off by default, because clothcalc does the same, and <b>because there are a number of rough edges</b> (meaning: this feature is not completed). It is here because it is usable.
