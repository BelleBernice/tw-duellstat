<dd>bugfix: some smaller fixes related to move_avatar_notibar.

<dd>New option to move the event counters to the top of the window (move_event_counters), off by default.
<dd>New option to remove the length restriction of the inventory search (misc_no_inv_search_maxlength), on by default. This means you can now search for 'fortune teller|reaper' to see the items of both new sets without having to use more or less bad abbreviations (which fail with the german item names).
<dd>Enhancement: You can now minimize the chat area (click on label of the chat miniwindow in the bottom left corner of the screen).
<dd>New: the alpha / work-in-progress version of a new ranking window. Tell me what you think about it. I don't often handle ranking these days.
<dt>0.76 - 2024-09-28
<dd>compatible to beta revision 8f34572 (2024/10/07 14:50:52)
<dt>0.75 - 2024-09-27
<dd>New option to decrease the waiting time on the octoberfest gambling animation (misc_gamblewindow_speedup). Use this if you have waited often enough in your live.
<dd>New option to delay the startup (startupdelay). Use this in case you encounter broken scripts or strange errors at the start of the game. This option is a brute force way to avoid the thundering herd problem.
<dd>New: add a link into the knowledgebase to the quest window. red means: that page might exist, or not, i've no way to check this.
<dd>New extra: questgroup combiner - this tries to match the names of the quests groups with those on innogames knowledge base.
<dd>Change: only load alliance data when it is needed, causing a slight delay in the duel map (thundering herd reduction).
<dd>Change: only load you craft data when it is needed, causing a slight delay in the market or crafting windows.
<dd>Bugfix: settings table was misformatted when using the german translation.

<dt>0.74 - 2024-09-11
<dd>New options to show task queue state and a low health warning to the favicon. off by default, you can activate this in the Task Queue settings. [taskqueue_length_in_favicon, taskqueue_length0_in_favicon, taskqueue_sleep_in_favicon, taskqueue_show_health_in_favicon]

<dd>New option to move the player popup/mouseover to the top of the fortbattle window (the default position disturbed the line of sight display). On by default. [fbmisc_movepopup]
<dd>New option to show the number of friends in the friendship request list window, defaults to on. [misc_enhance_friendslistwindow]
<dd>Enhancement: The settings tab now has a search function. This is a clear indication of a bad design somewhere.
<dd>Enhancement: the calculator now has an adventure mode.
<dd>Enhancement: the calculator has an "extraitems" input field, where you can enter item ids of items you might be interested in, to see how they would change things.
<dd>Enhancement: the storage window allows to search the market for missing items.
<dd>Enhancement: show collectibles in the job window even if the player found them already (once i though it smart to not show them if you already had found them, but i learned).
<dd>Enhancement: the simulator now allows slots to be empty.

<dd>Enhancement/Bugfix: make the duel level available in the statistics. the data has been collected from the start, just the option to show it was missing.
<dd>In the collector cards list (achievement window) show the items a card can be found in.
<dd>Bugfix: fixed a mistake causing the display of the players achievements and stats instead of the those of the player whose profile you clicked.

<dt>0.73 - 2024-05-22
<dd>New: a new extra: managing of recipients list for group telegrams.
<dd>Bugfix: townwindow member sorting by name didn't work for own town.
<dd>Bugfix: the market right select box in the sale dialogue sometimes showed the wrong text (in one of three cases, i think - but that may be language dependent).
<dd>Enhancement: the quest window helper to craft an item wasn't shown for the four new thing (cowboy stew, saddle seat and so on). These things have the wrong subtype in the database of the game servers. I added a workaround.
<dt>0.72 - 2024-04-08
<dd>Bugfix: duelmap failed to display all results if a date was unparsable.
<dt>0.71 - 2024-04-03 - Codename "i hate jerry" (#1).

<dd>New: a new extra to show interesting ghost towns: those with the lowest and the highest construction points.
<dd>New: "players at this location" has been augmented with a "summary" button, to show a breakdown of the players by alliances and towns (yes, this is for fort fights).

<dd>Improvement: joblist now has a raw data mode.
<dd>Improvement: shopsearch now has a mode to search only alliance towns.

<dd>Improvement: a new option to remove the shop sale info from the notibar.
<dd>Improvement: add fix for fortbattle graveyard screen overflow

<dd>Improvement: you now can sort the town residents window by rank (default) and name.
<dd>Bugfix: the prebattle rendering overwrote the own char icon and the target image when another player had set the same spot. 
<dd>Improvement: show wether multiple players are at the same spot in the prebattle window.
<dd>Bugfix: show helper functions in quests when the requirement is wear_changed, too.
<dd>Bugfix: speedcalc didn't work when a wear slot was empty.
<dd>Bugfix: people / duel list date handling was broken.
<dd>Bugfix: fort battle value display in the overlay didn't include the factor 1.15 for the attack value.

<dd>???: multiple missing german translations added.
<dt class='obsolete-marker'>0.68 - 2024-01-19
<dd>Bugfix: forts of towns without an alliance were ignored.
<dt>0.67 - 2024-01-19
<dd>New: A new extra, the alliance map (like TWDB).
<dd>New: A new extra, displaying a history of money, bonds and ranking data ("Statistics"). This is still work in progress, as i need to see how good the compression works over a longer time, and implement an expiration scheme then.
<dd>New: a night mode, where you can change the brightness of the game from, for example, 21:00 to 6:00, or from 9 to 18. I mainly implemented that just to prove that it's not useful at all, and now i like it. Oh well. You might want to give it a try.
<dd>New: add a quick access to all kind of useful equipment combinations.
<dd>Change: i cleaned up the duel equipment preset list in the calculator. Naming changed, parameters changed. If you depended on that know that i'm sorry, but that cleanup was really needed.
<dd>Improvement: you can now configure your own color code (for bonus jobs on the minimap) in the job list.
<dd>Improvement: Inventory supports sorting by damage.
<dd>Improvement: Inventory filter 'upgraded' catches non-upgraded items if there is an upgraded item of the kind in the bag.
<dd>Improvement: New inventory filter 'named' for named items. NOTE: This should have been easy, but the data in the game is a mess, and the 'named'-flag is unmaintained and seems to get set randomly. So i use an heuristics here. Which _will_ fail at some point.
<dd>Improvement: the "current" chrismas sale items can be shown in the overlay. I got that idea in the last 2 days of the event.
<dd>Improvement: added a button the quest window, to search for items in the shops.
<dd>Bugfix: the calculator did show items multiple times if multiple source (shop, auctionable) had been activated. This didn't affect the main result, only the display of useful items.
<dd>Bugfix: the trackbar had shown a NaN when you reached level 250.
<dt>0.66 - 2023-12-23
<dd>Improvement: added a cloth change button to the travelling fair construction window. On by default.
<dd>Bugfix: drag and drop to the market sell window/tab failed, causing the plain old 'create offer' window to be shown.
<dt>0.65 - 2023-12-21
<dd>Improvement: market sell window shows a summary of the state.
<dd>Bugfix: the calculator mistreated upgraded worn items if a non-upgraded or lower upgraded item is in the bag.
<dt>0.64 - 2023-12-20
<dd>Bugfix: the pinning buckets were broken by a superfluous to_cdn call (my mistake).
<dt>0.63 - 2023-12-12
<dd>Bugfix: the prebatttle chat topic copy was assumed to be clear text, but was HTML, and shown as text.
<dd>Bugfix: the duel level was used for the min bounty calculation, but the level would have sufficed.
<dt>0.62 - 2023-12-12
<dd>Improvement: format the numbers in the ranking window.
<dt>0.61 - 2023-12-11
<dd>Bugfix: This solves the problem with the vanishing option to disable the buildwindow enhancements.
<dd>Incompatibiliy note: The "TWIR Inventory Reloaded" extension to the build window (cloth button) is incompatible with clothcalc. You can either use the clothcache buildwindow extension or play with the load order of the scripts to load TWIR first. The way TWIR patches the functions (not only this one) is problematic. Not only makes makes it co-existance with other scripts hard or impossible, but it will fail if the original game function is changed.
<dt>0.60 - 2023-12-10
<dd>this release comes way to late. I screwed up when implementing various item popup enhancements, and implemented three different versions until i was was content with it.<br>
   There are still some things i should have done before this release (include a shop search to quest needing shop items, find a useful name for that matori mode, offer the speed set calculations where you'd use them (before jobs, for example), change the strategy for the town crafters search at least for small towns, and so on), but i want to get this release out of my way _now_.
<dd>New: town shop search (extras): allows to search for an item in shops of the nearby towns(like tw-calc does, but with caching).
<dd>New: add a function to delete all markers to the minimap (county 15 only).
<dd>Improvement: chat: set a default color for the chat with /defaultcolor NNN (/defaultcolor 990 sets yellow).
<dd>Improvement: chat: show all active players with /active command (active means non-idle).
<dd>Improvement: chat: "/ping foobar" calls foobar to the current chat ("Please come to someroomname (fortbattle chat)"
<dd>Improvement: the simulator now has a comparison mode and got a major rework.
<dd>Improvement: the larger inventory got a bit better, replaces TWIR now for me.
<dd>Improvement: wage calculation in the job list used the current clothes even in best clothes mode.
<dd>Improvement: craftwindow saves sort order.
<dd>Improvement: add matoris mode to the result display (instead of "need item" will display "have/need item" (1/1000 wood or so).
<dd>Improvement: calculator support construction (which is technically not a job, but a job-like hack).
<dd>Improvement: cloth calc button in the build window (well, it's not a 'button', but it works a such).
<dd>Improvement: bonus calc / bonus display supports job specific labor points.
<dd>Improvement: speedcalc has a new HP keeping mode (tries to find a speed set with more than your current HP).
<dd>Improvement: option to highlight finishable quests.
<dd>Improvement: option to show all non-idle players as such in the chat, not only the friends.
<dd>Improvement: pinning window: shows count for all items.
<dd>Improvement: show usable pinned items having a cooldown on the NotiBar

<dd>Improvement: show crafting level in the profile window
<dd>Improvement: show alliance name in the town window
<dd>Improvement: option to show a towns highest ranking crafters (i'll have to switch to another strategy, because that one is slow in most towns).
<dd>Improvement: show number of active battles
<dd>Improvement: settings: show the setting name in the table, for a (still to be implemented) search function
<dd>Improvement: craftcalc: make the result-area user-selectable (but why is there a difference between chromium and ff?).
<dd>Improvement: firefox clipboard screwup workaround (navigator.clipboard has no .readText(), docu. talks about clipboard-read permission request query, but the clipboard-read perm. is unknown) in the storage import. Browsers suck.
<dd>Improvement: iteminfo: show human friendly info too (the popup content).
<dd>Bugfix: speedcalc based it's bonus calc on all weapons of a set, and sometimes, but not always, found a less than perfect speed set.
<dd>Bugfix: the "missing item" filter in the market didn't work for usables.
<dd>Bugfix: fixed some job wages (high level jobs, small changes). It's still not perfect, i suspect the difference between my calc and the game calculation is in the rounding.
<dd>Bugfix: a border case in the injurywarning (task queue) code could cause it to fail after a page reload.
<dd>Bugfix: clear imgPath cache after start, in case it is already filled (normal water colors).
<dd>Bugfix: inventory statistic doubled the "experience in % of a level" value.
<dd>Bugfix: fixed the incompatibility with TW Big Inventory (though i recommend to use the clothcache inventory).
<dd>Bugfix: marketwindow enhancements didn't honor the setting, was done always (since about 10 versions).
<dt>0.59 - 2023-10-31
<dd>Improvement: you can send to all friends by clicking on the big flower/icon left of the event currency in the top bar.
<dt>0.58.1 - 2023-10-30
<dd>New: an option to show a VIP timer on the VIP badge.
<dd>New: an option to show a larger inventory. this is meant for those poor souls without TW Inventory Reloaded.
<dd>New: an option to increase / decrease the size of the notification bar.
<dd>New: an option allowing to set the default bounty.
<dd>New: a new extra, the calendar, shows the 'usual' event times. This escaped into the open in the last update, where it also was broken. There is still more work to do.
<dd>Improvement: pinning window shows item cooldown timer and item count.
<dd>Improvement: friends extra now have a function to send event currency to all eligible friends.
<dd>Bugfix: the jobwindow smart start feature could cause the browser window to hang if the motivation was 0, some job in the queue, and the used tried the button to start minus 1 (up to minus 9) jobs.
<dd>Improvement: the jobwindow allows to start 9 jobs (15s, 10m, 1h) if the motivation is 0.
<dd>Bugfix: the option to turn off the fort battle chat extension used a wrong translation.
<dd>Note: 0.58 didn't include the update information, and wasn't released.
<dt>0.57 - 2023-10-26
<dd>New: a fix for the tailors scrollbar. Oh, inno.
<dd>New: an alternative to clothcalcs pinning, also called pinning (quick access might be better?)
<dd>New: a replacement for clothcalcs duel status bar. You should deactivate either that or that of clothcalc.
<dd>Improvement: the market sale window information for the bulk mode can be turned off.
<dd>Improvement: the crafting window has a filter for items with a block time.
<dd>Improvement: the smart start feature in the job window (start multiple jobs at the same time) now considers the current task queue.
<dd>Improvement: the simulator (extra) now shows all jobs, not just one, and compares the equipment against the cached best (it has a filter function to reduce the number of results).
<dd>Improvement: the simulator has a set select, which allows to 'wear' all items of the set. This comes with a filter function, as the set selection is a major pain.
<dd>Improvement: the filter function also applies to the item selection.
<dd>Improvement: the itemuse / chest content now knows about the DoD event.
<dd>Improvement: the itemuse / chest content display allows to delete a line.
<dd>Bugfix: the final message shown after a bulk update of the clothcache (the functions in the settings) contained the word "undefined".
<dd>Bugfix: the simulator failed if an item combo didn't have a needed attribute.

<dt class='obsolete-marker'>0.56 - 2023-10-14 
<dd>Improvement: the market offer window (MOW) now shows the name of the thing in the title, like the travelling merchant sale does.
<dd>Improvement: the MOW now has a bulk mode. Use this if you trigger the "streak of bad luck" when selling on the market. The bulk mode causes the updates to the inventory and the list of items you sell to be updated only if you paused 8 seconds while selling.
<dd>Improvement: added a function to the MOW to add some percent of the current price. This is also a workaround for certain worlds where you can't sell named stuff at the minimum price, but have to use the immediate purchase price.
<dd>Improvement: a function to delete entries from the storage with match a given search string.
<dd>Improvement: a function to calculate the target sums in the storage from the comments.
<dd>Improvement: the inventory statistic shows the event currencies (hearts, pretzels and such things).
<dd>Improvement: added a 'missing item' filter to the market. Finally.
<dd>Improvement: added many missing translations, and display missing, but intended, translations to the logging.
<dd>Improvement: added a quick hack to include and display only a part of the update information with the script.
<dd>Change: removed the fix for the compost filter display, as tw-calc includes a fix now.
<dd>Bugfix: the storage showed all products (display problem).
<dd>Bugfix: the crafting resources filter in the market did nothing.
<dd>Bugfix: the tabular inventory item sell function used the wrong town (and even that was not done correctly), causing wrong fees to be shown.

<dt class='obsolete-marker'>0.55 - 2023-09-24 
<dd>New: renamed the thing to clothcache. goodbye, duellstat.
<dd>New: fortbattle chat: a click on the player name highlight the position on the battle field.
<dd>New: fortbattle chat: shows health points and health point losses in each round.
<dd>New: it's possible to highlight the messages button in the bottom row with a red border if there is a new tele. This is not too beautiful, but works, and has to be enable in the options (misc). Note that group teles also trigger the function, so... don't you hate group teles? 
<dd>New: an inventory statistics (extra). your inventories worth, the worth of the useless stuff, bonds in letter, exp. potions (% of level thing). Some things might be useful, some things are missing (like how many easter egg (think points, not buffs) i already have for the next event).
<dd>New: a new extra "iteminfo". Type in the number of the thing, and you'll see what's known about it. it's for me, not for you.
<dd>New: minimap: add a quick and dirty display of the tracked job groups to the county map. this is not useful if you have many open jobs, but nice there are just a few.
<dd>New: added an achievements page to the extras. it really helps if you need to find an achievement, and don't want to read 31 pages for that. there's a search function, too.
<dd>New: a new extra "buffs" lists all known buffs in the game. it's sortable. 

<dd>Improvement: craftcalc window shows the number of resources available, allows to buy / sell them on the market, and also allows a bit more flexibility when dividing resources. 
<dd>Improvement: chest statistics now includes the wins of the pretzel event. rockets event, too. Wow, it's been a long time since 0.54.
<dd>Improvement: storage: show if a silver/gold job is known.
<dd>Improvement: you can add short note into the title of the job window (far left of the title, needs to be enabled in the settings). You might use this to remember which bonus equipment you can use, or whatever you need, but keep it short.
<dd>Improvement: show which job drops an collectible (0.54 added the reverse thing).
<dd>Improvement: inventory shows the number of items wanted in the storage (still not perfect, deactivated when that thing drops from a job, but an improment anyway).
<dd>Improvement: itemsettab: make it a large window.
<dd>Improvement: don't switch the main window to the bonus tab if the equipment changes. 
<dd>Improvement: sort the extras by alphabet.

<dd>Change: calculator: renamed 'event and others' to non-auctionable, to be more clear. added a blacklist for pay-to-win shit and extremely rare stuff.
<dd>Bugfix: craftwindow: it had a limit of 1000 units per crafting action, which has been removed. As a side effect the click on the max. number (in paratheses left of it) now doesn't use the 1000 anymore, and just works as intended.
<dd>Bugfix: craftwindow: solved the issue with the order of events, causing slow updates.
<dd>Bugfix: the speedcalc function judged animals by their speed bonus, not their base speed. Fixed.
<dd>Bugfix: speedcalc might have miscalculated by using the currently equipped animal. The bug was there, but whether it really is another question.
<dd>Bugfix: the storage tab could not be opened is you had one of the rare things for the level 600 crafting recipes in it (habaneros, cobra teeth and ...). in general it would fail if you included an item which is dropable, but without a specific job.
<dd>Bugfix: fixed the redraw problem of the minimap (extensions vanished)
<dd>Bugfix: since 0.52 the equipment calculator didn't like floating point input anymore, but i still sent that. Stupid me.
<dd>Bugfix: the calculation of the time needed to collect resources for crafted stuff did almost everything right, but didn't multiply the times with the number of resources. "Almost right" is the same as "totally wrong".
<dd>Bugfix: removed a duplicate setting for the market.
<dd>Bugfix: equipment tab: wear button didn't work.
<dd>Bugfix: sleep helper: now caches forts w/o barracks, too, for dying montana.
<dd>Bugfix: item set tab: click on the set didn't open the set window.

<dt>0.54 - 2023-05-26
<dd>New: a new extra, the simulator, allows targeted exploration of any equipment known to the game (you can see how usefull a new piece of equipment would be).
<dd>New: a replacement for the craftwindow, allowing you to buy from and sell on the market, start a job, ... and craft, of course.
<dd>Improvement: the jobwindow shows collectible items dropped by that job in the title.
<dd>Improvement: craft item list is reloaded as soon as a new recipe is learned.
<dd>Improvement: a click on the storage area of the trackbar opens the storage tab.
<dd>Bugfix: the profile text click was too greedy.
<dd>Bugfix: overlay fortbattle value calculation should now match that of tw-calc (and the game, too).

<dt class='obsolete-marker'>0.53 - 2023-04-07
<dd>New: add a fortbattle data display to the overlay.
<dd>New: add a generic calculator (jobs, duels, fortbattle, you name it) to the extras.
<dd>New: add craftcalc, a calculator for the items needed when crafting.
<dd>New: add option to change the payment default to the event currency (easter eggs and so on) instead of nuggets

<dd>New: add two additional modes to the speed calculation.
<dd>New: added option to highlight bonus jobs to the job list.
<dd>New: friend list (sortable, always reachable, with class/profession).
<dd>New: mark market prices red/black/blue/green depending on the collection times of the items needed (configurable).
<dd>New: new extra townlog, showing a summary of the town log.
<dd>New: option to highlight items missing in the storage in the market.
<dd>Improvement: chest opening statistics for valentine and easter events
<dd>Improvement: collections: add direct search for the matching job to the collection window (new dropable collection items).
<dd>Improvement: collections: allow to search in town shops 
<dd>Improvement: gencalc: change subset limit to 1000, for the sleepyhead set (might not be an improment on weak machines, though).
<dd>Improvement: make the coords clickable in the other half of the minimap gold/silver export, too.
<dd>Change: moved the job tab to extras and an own window.
<dd>Bugfix: disregard HP when calculating a regeneration set.
<dd>Bugfix: fix the question text when changing the name of a duellstat equipment set.
<dd>Bugfix: fort battle statistics were broken if an attacker was killed in the first round
<dd>Bugfix: reduce the localstorage space needed by more than 90%.

<dd>Internal: bit the bullet and started to modularize the translations.
<dd>Old: re-add the fix for the compost recipe display (twcalc workaround)
<dt>0.52 - 2023-01-11
<dd>New: A new extra, showing your inventory as a table.
<dd>Improvement: The set display can now handle item leveling.
<dt>0.51 - 2022-12-19
<dd>New: Add a navigation option to the minimap, off by default. This also implements the search mode, where the user interface is transparent. Try the cursor keys when in search mode.
<dd>New: added an option to go to the profile text editor when clicking on your own profile text.
<dd>New: a shift-click on the number in the upper right corner of an inventory item will open the item in the usage tab, so you can see where it is used. I had to replace the scrollbar for that.
<dd>New: Implement an information overlay containing character and equipment information, and a easiely seen note area. That duell stuff still is bound to change.
<dd>New: display chance for lucky find in the job window.
<dd>New: add buttons to start as much jobs as possible in the same motivation class.
<dd>New: Since the number of tabs grew to far, i exiled a number of functions to the Extras tab, where you can open these functions in new windows. Moved WUW there.
<dd>New: add a collections helper and a list of missing items (Extras/Collections).
<dd>New: show the currently available quests at all quest givers.
<dd>New: item usage / chest opening stats.
<dd>New: add time to collect items to the items popup (assuming no VIP, no adventurer bonus, no product drop chance enhancements, and not reaching 5 gold stars).

<dd>Improvement: Many things translated to german. Still quite a lot of english visible.
<dd>Improvement: The startup code waits for the itemmanager to be loaded. This also fixes a number of cases where duellstat tried to run before TW was ready (causing DS to fail).
<dd>Improvement: Market buy: add some filters. This is still not quite free of bugs.
<dd>Improvement: Jobs tab: highlight jobs with known gold/silver instances.
<dd>Bugfix: the barrack search (sleep function) doesn't uncache fully built barracks anymore.

<dt>0.50 - 2022-11-16

<dd>New: option to always show the "max" button at the traveling merchant.

	</ul>
